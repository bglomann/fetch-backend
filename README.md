fetch-backend
=============

## Back-end service layer for whocanfetch.it

This code base originated at the [Paypal Battle Hack Miami](http://battlehack.org/miami/)
August 24-25, 2013. It was initially created by Bernhard Glomann and Warren Small using
[Spring Tool Suite 3.3.0](http://www.springsource.org/sts).

The goal of this project is to create an online service (web app and possibly mobile apps)
that brings together people who need something picked up/ fetched/ delivered and the people
who can do that for them. People who don't have transportation or just want to save time
can submit tasks (which consist of items that need to be picked up from one location and
dropped off at another), and others can search for tasks that they may be able to do
on their way and earn a little money doing so.
